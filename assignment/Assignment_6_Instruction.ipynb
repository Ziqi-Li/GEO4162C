        "1. Get the health data from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ziqi-Li/GEO4162C/main/data/cdc_health_county.csv`, and create a DataFrame `health_df`. (5%)\n",
        "2. Get the socio-economic data from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Ziqi-Li/GEO4162C/main/data/acs_2019.csv` and create a DataFrame named `socio_df`. (5%)\n",
        "3. Join the two DataFrames together using a common key. The key in `health_df` is `LocationID` and the key in `socio_df` is `county_id`. Hint: Use the function `combined_df = pd.merge(df1,df2,left_on=\"key1\",right_on=\"key2\")`. (10%)\n",
        "4. Perform linear regression analysis on `combined_df`, using `statsmodels` by choosing **one** dependent variable in `health_df`, and **three** independent variables in `socio_df`. (20%)\n",
        "5. Report and interpret your linear regression results  regarding your model R2, regression coefficients, and statistical significance of the coefficients. (40%)\n",
        "6. Create 1) a residual vs. fit plot and 2) a Q-Q plot to check the model residual assumptions. Descibe why we need to make the two plots, and do your plots meet the assumptions and what are the assumptions? (20%)\n"
